# NFSRODS
An [nfs4j](https://github.com/dCache/nfs4j) Virtual File System implementation supporting the iRODS Data Grid.

## Features
- Configurable
- Exposes iRODS through a mount point
- Clients avoid the need for learning icommands
- Clients avoid the need to install additional iRODS packages
- Supports many common *nix commands and software (e.g. mkdir, truncate, cat, vim, etc.)

## Requirements
- iRODS v4.2.5+
- [iRODS REP for Collection Mtime](https://github.com/irods/irods_rule_engine_plugin_update_collection_mtime)
- Java Development Kit (JDK v8)
- Maven
- OS NFS packages (e.g Ubuntu 16.04: nfs-common)

## Compiling, Running, and Mounting
The following instructions assume you're running Ubuntu 16.04 and Bash.

The root account is only needed when running the software and using mount. It is
not necessary for compiling.

### Compiling
```bash
$ cd /path/to/irods_client_nfsrods
$ mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

After compiling, you should see output similar to the following:
```bash
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Reactor Summary:
[INFO] 
[INFO] nfs4j-irodsvfs ..................................... SUCCESS [  0.671 s]
[INFO] nfsrods ............................................ SUCCESS [ 12.955 s]
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 17.378 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2018-09-13T13:10:25+00:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 43M/1844M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

You should also have two new JAR files under the `irods-vfs-impl/target` directory. Listing
the contents of this directory should produce output similar to the following:
```bash
$ ls -l /path/to/irods_client_nfsrods/irods-vfs-impl/target
total 11564
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 Sep 13 13:10 archive-tmp
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root     4096 Sep 13 13:10 classes
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root     4096 Sep 13 13:10 generated-sources
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 11792342 Sep 13 13:10 nfsrods-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    30246 Sep 13 13:10 nfsrods-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 Sep 13 13:10 maven-archiver
```

### Running
Make sure to update the NFSRODS server config file with the correct iRODS.

The config file is located at `/path/to/irods_client_nfsrods/irods-vfs-impl/config/server.json`.
Each config option is explained below.
```javascript
{
    // This section defines options needed by the NFS server.
    "nfs_server": {
        // The port number to listen on for requests. Here, we've chosen to
        // use a non-standard port number instead of the default, 2049. However,
        // this change does require the client to specify the port when creating
        // the mount point (this is demonstrated later).
        "port": 2050,
        
        // The path within iRODS that will represent the root collection.
        // We recommend setting this to the zone. Using the zone as the root
        // collection allows all clients to access shared collections and data
        // objects outside of their home collection.
        "irods_mount_point": "/tempZone"
    },

    // This section defines the location of the iRODS server being presented
    // by NFSRODS. Multiple iRODS servers and zones is not supported. The
    // NFSRODS server can only be configured to present a single zone.
    "irods_server": {
        "host": "hostname",
        "port": 1247,
        
        // The iRODS zone to operate under.
        "zone": "tempZone",
        
        // Because NFS does not have any notion of iRODS, you must define which
        // resource to operate under.
        "default_resource": "demoResc"
    },

    // An administrative iRODS account is required to carry out each request.
    // The account specified here is used as a proxy to connect to the iRODS
    // server. iRODS will still apply policies based on the client's account,
    // not the proxy account.
    "irods_proxy_admin_account": {
        "username": "rods",
        "password": "rods"
    }
}
```

After updating the config file, you should be able to run the server using the following commands:
```bash
$ export NFSRODS_HOME=/path/to/irods_client_nfsrods/irods-vfs-impl
$ sudo -E java -jar $NFSRODS_HOME/target/nfsrods-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

### Mounting
```bash
$ sudo mkdir <mount_point>
$ sudo mount -o sec=sys,port=2050 <hostname>:/ <mount_point>
```

If you do not receive any errors after mounting, then you should be able to access the mount
point like so:
```bash
$ cd <mount_point>/path/to/collection_or_data_object
```

## Logging
NFSRODS uses Log4j for managing and writing log files. The default config will log messages with a
level >= `WARN` to `stdout`. The config file is located at
`/path/to/irods_client_nfsrods/irods-vfs-impl/config/log4j.properties`.
Configuring Log4j is out of scope for this documentation. It should be easy to google steps on this.

## Running the Test Suite
At this point, you should have a functional NFSRODS server. If not, please review the previous sections 
before continuing.

### Requirements
- Docker (as of this writing, v18.09.0)
- Bash Automated Testing System (Bats)

### Building the Docker image
```bash
$ cd /path/to/irods_client_nfsrods/irods-vfs-impl/testing/docker
$ ./build_image.sh
```

If the build succeeds, you should now have a new docker image called `nfsrods_test_image`. You can verify 
this by typing the following:
```bash
$ docker image ls
```

Using this docker image, you can now launch as many iRODS servers as you want. For the test suite, we'll
only need one. To launch, execute the following:
```bash
$ docker run -d --name nfsrods_test_env -p 9000:1247 nfsrods_test_image
```

This command launches the image in a container named **nfsrods_test_env** and exposes the iRODS server on
port **9000**. Feel free to adjust these values.

### Kerberos Test Principal
The docker container you just launched uses default arguments to configure the iRODS server. You will need to
create a new Kerberos principal for the iRODS service account. Without this, you will not be able to mount
the NFSRODS server or run the tests.

As mentioned earlier, the name used for the Kerberos principal must match the iRODS account name. For the
docker image, the account name is **rods**. The Kerberos principal must be **rods@REALM**.

### Final Steps
Once the Kerberos principal is ready for use, you'll need to update the NFSRODS server config so that it
points to the docker container. You should only need to change the **hostname** and **port**. Refer to the
section titled [Running](#Running) for more information about the config file.

The test suite requires that **Bats** be installed. You can find instructions for downloading and installing
Bats [here](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core).

### Run the Test Suite
```bash
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/nfsrods
$ sudo mount -o sec=sys,port=2050 <hostname>:/ /mnt/nfsrods
$ bats /path/to/irods_client_nfsrods/irods-vfs-impl/testing/behavior_tests.bats
```

## TODOs
